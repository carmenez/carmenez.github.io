<p>Creating Binary Games was really challenging fun.  Individuals moved between systems for teaching binary as well as tools for quick conversion of binary numbers to base 10 numbers.  Min and I came up with Binary Stairs, a combination of twister and musical chairs.  In this 2 player game, the values of each bit are placed on a stair.  Anyone calls out a number or binary code and you have to touch each bit that represents the base 10 number or binary pattern. Nahee and brandon each came up with a great ways to teach binary using a rescuing scenario board game and a measured representations of the bits to get their corresponding bit pattern.</p>

<p>Programming: lets discuss and demystify.  Just talking vocabulary…</p>
<p>what is computation? Numbers? Computers? Processes that solve and translate? here are our thoughts.</p>
<p>:: input/output :: symbols :: memory :: usb :: processor [cpu] :: sensors [keyboard &amp; mouse] :: output [screen] :: I/O busses :: wifi :: conductive :: abstraction/modeling :: metal :: silicon :: copper :: fans :: temperature :: capacitors :: resistors :: batteries :: lights :: motherboard :: electricity ::</p>
<p>these words reminds me of a functioning 22nd century city- maybe an electric city with radiant atmospheres.  I could even imagine this city as a virtual model with integrated sensors aka. people called capacitors.  The rebels, who want to mix reality are the resistors.  but the motherboard doesn’t like the symbol of freedom so they are taken to the batteries via I/O busses driven by wifi memory conductors to be processed.  high temperatures spilling blood and light out of usbs installed on resistor wrists.   high fans built of metal cool silicon and copper models being made by capacitors.  only 10110110 11010111 left.</p>

<p>I guess thats an accurate representation of my brain-short tangential distractions welcome.</p>
