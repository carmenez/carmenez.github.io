<p>Creating Binary Games was really challenging fun.  Individuals moved between systems for teaching binary as well as tools for quick conversion of binary numbers to base 10 numbers.  Min and I came up with Binary Stairs, a combination of twister and musical chairs.  In this 2 player game, the values of each bit are placed on a stair.  Anyone calls out a number or binary code and you have to touch each bit that represents the base 10 number or binary pattern. Nahee and brandon each came up with a great ways to teach binary using a rescuing scenario board game and a measured representations of the bits to get their corresponding bit pattern.</p>

<p>Programming: lets discuss and demystify.  Just talking vocabulary…</p>
<p>what is computation? Numbers? Computers? Processes that solve and translate? here are our thoughts.</p>
<p>:: input/output :: symbols :: memory :: usb :: processor [cpu] :: sensors [keyboard &amp; mouse] :: output [screen] :: I/O busses :: wifi :: conductive :: abstraction/modeling :: metal :: silicon :: copper :: fans :: temperature :: capacitors :: resistors :: batteries :: lights :: motherboard :: electricity ::</p>
<p>these words reminds me of a functioning 22nd century city- maybe an electric city with radiant atmospheres.  I could even imagine this city as a virtual model with integrated sensors aka. people called capacitors.  The rebels, who want to mix reality are the resistors.  but the motherboard doesn’t like the symbol of freedom so they are taken to the batteries via I/O busses driven by wifi memory conductors to be processed.  high temperatures spilling blood and light out of usbs installed on resistor wrists.   high fans built of metal cool silicon and copper models being made by capacitors.  only 10110110 11010111 left.</p>

<p>Command Line :: terminal, Scode, editors</p>
<p>IDE :: integrated development environment [examples: processing &amp; arduino]</p>
<p>Function :: the relationship between input and output, the method &amp; actions</p>
<p>Control Structure :: Loop :: repetition :: IF :: conditional</p>
<p>Variable :: holds a value, small units, can change</p>
<p>Object :: class</p>

<p>while data might be replicated or sometimes salvaged, embodiment and the material world cannot be replaced</p>

<h3 id="interview-with-claude-shannon"><a href="#interview-with-claude-shannon" class="headerlink" title="interview with claude shannon"></a>interview with claude shannon</h3><p>Claude Shannon:<br>[telling a story about Alan Turing]</p>
<p>So I asked him what he was doing.<br>And he said he was trying to find a way to get better feedback from a computer so he would know what was going on inside the computer.<br>And he’d invented this wonderful command.<br>See, in those days they were working with individual commands.<br>And the idea was to discover good commands.<br>And I said, what is the command? And he said, the command is put a pulse to the hooter, put a pulse to the hooter.<br>Now let me translate that.<br>A hooter is an English, in England is a loudspeaker.<br>And by putting a pulse to it, it would just be put a pulse to a hooter.<br>Now what good is this crazy command?<br>Well, the good of this command is that if you’re in a loop you can have this command in that loop<br>and every time it goes around the loop it will put a pulse in and you will hear a frequency equal to<br>how long it takes to go around that loop. And then you can put another one in some bigger loop and so on.<br>And so you’ll hear all of this coming on and you’ll hear this “boo boo boo boo boo boo,”[CS vocalizing in a sing-song fashion]<br>and his concept was that you would soon learn to listen to that and know whether when it got hung up in a loop or something else or what<br>it was doing all this time, which he’d never been able to tell before.<br>That was a great idea, but I don’t think it was really a very good idea.<br>That command seems to have disappeared from the vocabulary. [laughs]</p>
<h3 id="COMPUTING-MACHINERY-AND-INTELLIGENCE"><a href="#COMPUTING-MACHINERY-AND-INTELLIGENCE" class="headerlink" title="COMPUTING MACHINERY AND INTELLIGENCE"></a>COMPUTING MACHINERY AND INTELLIGENCE</h3><p>By A. M. Turing (an excerpt)</p>
<p>The short answer to this argument is that although it is established that there are<br>limitations to the Powers of any particular machine, it has only been stated, without<br>any sort of proof, that no such limitations apply to the human intellect. But I do not<br>think this view can be dismissed quite so lightly. Whenever one of these machines<br>is asked the appropriate critical question, and gives a definite answer, we know that<br>this answer must be wrong, and this gives us a certain feeling of superiority. Is this<br>feeling illusory? It is no doubt quite genuine, but I do not think too much<br>importance should be attached to it. We too often give wrong answers to questions<br>ourselves to be justified in being very pleased at such evidence of fallibility on the<br>part of the machines. Further, our superiority can only be felt on such an occasion<br>in relation to the one machine over which we have scored our petty triumph. There<br>would be no question of triumphing simultaneously over all machines. In short,<br>then, there might be men cleverer than any given machine, but then again there<br>might be other machines cleverer again, and so on</p>
