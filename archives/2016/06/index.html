            <p>Prompt: Create an autonomous online network</p>
<p>Well, what is an autonomous network?</p>
<p>A Rhizome is: a continuously growing horizontal underground stem that puts out lateral shoots and adventitious roots at intervals. </p>
<p>An autonomous network allows the users to deflect “normal” networking systems. I decided to create an autonomous network for the MTA riders.  Having been part of the design and maintenance of Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART) and a public transit rider, I have experienced the “unknown delay.” Often I think about how the underground experience is without internet, and its users have  to depend on the train conductor to get information about the status of our charriot. What is happening? How long will we be here? Can I take another change? NO SIGNAL, results in confused, aggrivated, and unhappy commuters.  </p>
<p>What if a [mesh] network could exist so individuals could get real time information from somewhere above the water table.  If a train has been stopped for more than 10 minutes, an autonomous network would appear and allow us to find out from news sources if there has been a malfunction, an attack, any issue that has caused the infrastructure to stop performing and alert us to alternatives on how to move around, giving us control of our commute.</p>

<p>future<br>In earth years, technically I’m 80 but I haven’t changed much since 2040 when puReality finished and true mixedReality was implemented into every human.alive.Now, time is no longer something that can be measured, its infinite and can be re-arranged to fit our needs, which turns out- has solved a lot of problems.  Now, I can map time from months to hours, when I need to, but can still adhere to the atomic clock. Time, like humans, are now irrelivant. I’ll try to paint you a picture of new reality and give you some instructions on how to move around the multiverse, while I look through my past for an installation I worked on, that attempted to evoke emotions in machines. </p>
<p>First thing to understand is that reality can no longer be measured.  Thought predictive software creates everything-instantly out of organic nano-materials pumped into the air (thats actually non-allergenic and the only side-effect is an increse in human metabolism).  Each human has its own holographic Thought Machine that can print or visualize any thought, need, and evoke any feeling desired. Sometimes its a little off, but that is only because each unit creats a version of what they think their human unit would want, and we humans think alot.Since each thought can be created, erased,re-imagined, and re-printed, we aren’t creating too much waste.  If you have any trouble, call a HologramHelper, they’re great for small talk, keeping you company and are essential to the management of our timeless complex systems and lives.  </p>
<p>HologramHelpers have taken over all industries freeing humans to “only” think about new ideas or develop ideas already generated through human hyper-connectness. A vissionary at SFPC, one of my teachers actually created the framework for super-collaboration and defined the specifics of machine-human relationship. Based on a master/slave dynamic of working together, ideating and documenting. Knowledge Sharing campuses. Super Schools housed in historical buildings, like West Beth, have become Knowledge Campuses, capable of remotely monitoring, backing-up, and documenting all learning, thoughts, and ideas. Plus, super computers are constantly updating existing software and hardware to make this process easier, cheaper, faster, and take up less memory, to allow for constant hyper-connectness. </p>
<p>Librarians can grant instant accessablility for all people with an implant, but if you’re a true human, you can sign up for a library card, wait in a suspended landscape, and they’ll alert you when it’s ready.</p>
<p>Is your chip overheating? firmware off? are you waiting for your KnowledgeCampus access card? Head outside and take a bubble or wander onto a floating landscape.  Choose from pre-designed environments, nostalgic pasts, or bold futures.  Contemplate or meditate -sans chip- for eternity, or for a fixed amount of time, remember your vacation time can always be re-mapped, so don’t stress, enjoy yourself. </p>
<p>Who do you love? Are they far? No problem, connected super structures allow for storage or human transfers through re-mapped time and space.  These mega-highways of information transfer will send you or your idea-data from your KnowledgeCampus, to any other Super School.   </p>
<p>What about storage and memory? We have many options in the mega productive structures that have been developed in emerging underground cities. These cities are for machines only.  Down there humans are irrelevant.  There is nothing for them, except for space for your stuff.  The only thing down there is organized copies of your past selves that you’ve tried to shed and memories of partners you’ve left or family you once had, oh yeah…and the never ending noise of machines working.</p>
<p>Sometimes when I’m laying on my suspended island, gazing out into the multiverse, I think back to puReality. I have glitch memories of physical materials, mechanical machines, screens.  When love was powered by software, computers ran out of batteries, and everything was done by people.  I miss the days when we all used to work, using our hands and our minds. We have come so far, yet there are many feelings I no longer have, long nights collaborating-pulling my hair out to try to figure something out-on my own- but that all came with a price.  Life was slow, ideas-stayed ideas, and projects were backed up on memory chips as big as our thumbs! My projects from 2016 should be backed up somewhere, unless I naively thought I would remember.  These days I can’t even remember what Earth was like when life was puReality - pre-implants.  </p>
<p>I can’t remember specifics of puReality, but certain things seem familiar.  I know there was a process to making things: thoughts, sketches, prototypes.  I used to struggle, fumbling between operating systems, technologies, robotic arms, components, shields, wires, boards, projectors, computers and running only on human direction and a little bit of computer memory.  During my time at SFPC I was really working on my critical thinking skills, so myprojects were less shiny. </p>
<p>I didnt leave very good documentation, no “how to” “readMe.md” and nothing published to github.io.  Looking back, most of my projects<br>looked like they were made it in a weekend staying up on red bulls. electrical tape and wire…plus you can tell its from 2016 from the Solder Job.  looks like it was all done with a fisher price, my first soldering kit. I did design the heart+brain: the chip + code, here it is-protected and packaged in a little 3D printed box (probably a makerbot, soo vintage you can even see the filament), designed and milled and programmed by your’s truely.  Most parts of  puReality are blurry, but something feels familiar, maybe its an emotion i’ve lost-touching something physical, reminds me of a life past, forgotten, updated, and replaced. </p>

<p> 155 Bank St – WestBeth once the Bell Telephone Laboratories (between 1898 and 1966) now a building for Artists and The School for Poetic Computation is an industrial complex. Brick exterior and welcoming public spaces leave its visitors feeling like they are visiting an oasis in the west village.  as we are studying within a complex that influenced, transformed and developed modern day technology. –<a href="http://ethw.org/Bell_Labs" target="_blank" rel="external">http://ethw.org/Bell_Labs</a><br>Claude Shannon – 1916-2001- After graduating in 1936, Shannon went directly to MIT to take up a work-study position he had seen advertised on a postcard tacked to a campus bulletin board…</p>
<p>This was a man who would explore machine learning in the 1940’s.  A researcher who “demonstrated the essential unity of all information media, pointing out that text, telephone signals, radio waves, pictures, film and every other mode of communication could be encoded in the universal language of binary digits, or bits-a term that his article was the first to use in print.” A man who would go on to publish, develop, and push the technology of the modern time.</p>
<p>So, what was on the card that gave him a reason to start working at Bell Labs? Was it a graphic? Was he in need for money and going to take the first job he could get? What was the visual vernacular? How did graphic artists explain technology?</p>
<p>I saw Megan Prelinger speak at Grey Area and discuss the graphic design in early technology.  the early radio, telephone, and electricity companies in the United States were shown to the public through a graphic language. Technology and graphic design grew together through two mediums: trade literature and science fiction.  Prelinger states that visual images were used to attract budding engineers by advertising utopian worlds through a scientific lens.  Circuit schematic symbols were used in the begenning of design and art with electronics.  Begenning with simplified lines &amp; form in the 1950’s then moving to numbers binary.</p>

<p>Face++ started from SnapChat.  We were swapping faces and noticed that there were a few facial recognition commands that the application recognized. We decided to expand our language from a – “Open your mouth” and “Raise your eyebrows” – to 16 different facial expressions.<br>We decided to figure out a way to write a programming language that would run on laughter.  You can write using your face and once you’ve created your code, trigger laughter to compile and run it.  Melanie pointed out that this would actually be a great programming language for people with disabilities, more specifically targeting those who are paralyzed from the neck down.</p>

<p>Experimenting a little bit with the code, we switched in some images from the Codex Seraphinianus to generate some beautiful tiling patterns, resulting in the featured image.</p>

<p>Some other really beautiful coding languages were created.  Melanie translated a simple, “helloWorld” to 7 of the most common languages. And Max created a mobile to hang above your babies crib so your child can get familiar with coding(?). KristaAnn created a programming language from Tarot Cards, and Min created instructions for programmers. (i think)</p>
