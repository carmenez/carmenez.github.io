<p>Investigating past computational artists led us to get to know the work of Muriel Cooper and John Maeda.  I am inspired by these images: </p>

<p>Day 2.  I’m getting used to a longer commute, I can usually read one (maaayyybbbeee 2) pages over and over about 4-6 times from the Morgan stop on the L to 14th.  I get distracted by all the New Yorkers shuttled around in little tin cans coming, going, and hosting all sorts.  The metro doesn’t discriminate.</p>
<p>This week is full of ice-breaking, bonding, and drawing.  One of the most exciting things is that CLASS STARTED ON TIME! wow. It’s great to be part of a community that cares about their experience enough that they actively make an effort to participate.  It is encouraging to see my piers as well as my teachers at sfpc and ready at the time they said they would be.</p>

<p>Human Fax Machine + Simple Rules Drawings.  Zach asked us to participate in a few exercises that got us thinking like computers.  In human fax machine, we were asked to communicate through sound.  to do this one must create a protocol for converting drawings into sound.  Then, define rules for sending and receiving in order to transform information from one language to another.  We started with directional representations and their sounds(up(mount sound)/down(heavy hand on table)/left(flick on the table)/right(scratch the table)) + (pause//clap) Then we established a set of rules. 1. sound out coordinates (x,y) on the page, when complete, pause. 2. draw a unit of line for each sound representation heard. 3. pause when complete.  This was a really interesting way of defining rules and the importance of being specific.  Although the rules were specific, it was difficult for us to translate the sounds to images.  There was a lot of thinking, eyebrow furrowing, and starting over.<br>Drawing got us to follow simple rules that allowed us to generate without thinking.  The goal was to be fill up a big sheet of paper quickly by turning the rules into a drawing.</p>

<p>Exercise 1: start by drawing a straight line at any length, angle, and position.  Next line can only be drawing on previous lines &amp; no crossing.</p>
<p>Exercise 2: Fill the circle to make it perfect.</p>
<p>Exercise 3: Make your own rules: draw 90 degree arcs in any direction.  Next arc must be offset a few units from any arc and drawing in any direction on any point on the line.</p>
<p>I really loved this exercise.</p>
<p>I also did my own interpertations</p>

<p>future<br>In earth years, technically I’m 80 but I haven’t changed much since 2040 when puReality finished and true mixedReality was implemented into every human.alive.Now, time is no longer something that can be measured, its infinite and can be re-arranged to fit our needs, which turns out- has solved a lot of problems.  Now, I can map time from months to hours, when I need to, but can still adhere to the atomic clock. Time, like humans, are now irrelivant. I’ll try to paint you a picture of new reality and give you some instructions on how to move around the multiverse, while I look through my past for an installation I worked on, that attempted to evoke emotions in machines. </p>
<p>First thing to understand is that reality can no longer be measured.  Thought predictive software creates everything-instantly out of organic nano-materials pumped into the air (thats actually non-allergenic and the only side-effect is an increse in human metabolism).  Each human has its own holographic Thought Machine that can print or visualize any thought, need, and evoke any feeling desired. Sometimes its a little off, but that is only because each unit creats a version of what they think their human unit would want, and we humans think alot.Since each thought can be created, erased,re-imagined, and re-printed, we aren’t creating too much waste.  If you have any trouble, call a HologramHelper, they’re great for small talk, keeping you company and are essential to the management of our timeless complex systems and lives.  </p>
<p>HologramHelpers have taken over all industries freeing humans to “only” think about new ideas or develop ideas already generated through human hyper-connectness. A vissionary at SFPC, one of my teachers actually created the framework for super-collaboration and defined the specifics of machine-human relationship. Based on a master/slave dynamic of working together, ideating and documenting. Knowledge Sharing campuses. Super Schools housed in historical buildings, like West Beth, have become Knowledge Campuses, capable of remotely monitoring, backing-up, and documenting all learning, thoughts, and ideas. Plus, super computers are constantly updating existing software and hardware to make this process easier, cheaper, faster, and take up less memory, to allow for constant hyper-connectness. </p>
<p>Librarians can grant instant accessablility for all people with an implant, but if you’re a true human, you can sign up for a library card, wait in a suspended landscape, and they’ll alert you when it’s ready.</p>
<p>Is your chip overheating? firmware off? are you waiting for your KnowledgeCampus access card? Head outside and take a bubble or wander onto a floating landscape.  Choose from pre-designed environments, nostalgic pasts, or bold futures.  Contemplate or meditate -sans chip- for eternity, or for a fixed amount of time, remember your vacation time can always be re-mapped, so don’t stress, enjoy yourself. </p>
<p>Who do you love? Are they far? No problem, connected super structures allow for storage or human transfers through re-mapped time and space.  These mega-highways of information transfer will send you or your idea-data from your KnowledgeCampus, to any other Super School.   </p>
<p>What about storage and memory? We have many options in the mega productive structures that have been developed in emerging underground cities. These cities are for machines only.  Down there humans are irrelevant.  There is nothing for them, except for space for your stuff.  The only thing down there is organized copies of your past selves that you’ve tried to shed and memories of partners you’ve left or family you once had, oh yeah…and the never ending noise of machines working.</p>
<p>Sometimes when I’m laying on my suspended island, gazing out into the multiverse, I think back to puReality. I have glitch memories of physical materials, mechanical machines, screens.  When love was powered by software, computers ran out of batteries, and everything was done by people.  I miss the days when we all used to work, using our hands and our minds. We have come so far, yet there are many feelings I no longer have, long nights collaborating-pulling my hair out to try to figure something out-on my own- but that all came with a price.  Life was slow, ideas-stayed ideas, and projects were backed up on memory chips as big as our thumbs! My projects from 2016 should be backed up somewhere, unless I naively thought I would remember.  These days I can’t even remember what Earth was like when life was puReality - pre-implants.  </p>
<p>I can’t remember specifics of puReality, but certain things seem familiar.  I know there was a process to making things: thoughts, sketches, prototypes.  I used to struggle, fumbling between operating systems, technologies, robotic arms, components, shields, wires, boards, projectors, computers and running only on human direction and a little bit of computer memory.  During my time at SFPC I was really working on my critical thinking skills, so myprojects were less shiny. </p>
<p>I didnt leave very good documentation, no “how to” “readMe.md” and nothing published to github.io.  Looking back, most of my projects<br>looked like they were made it in a weekend staying up on red bulls. electrical tape and wire…plus you can tell its from 2016 from the Solder Job.  looks like it was all done with a fisher price, my first soldering kit. I did design the heart+brain: the chip + code, here it is-protected and packaged in a little 3D printed box (probably a makerbot, soo vintage you can even see the filament), designed and milled and programmed by your’s truely.  Most parts of  puReality are blurry, but something feels familiar, maybe its an emotion i’ve lost-touching something physical, reminds me of a life past, forgotten, updated, and replaced. </p>

<p>John whitney used mathematics and analog machines to bend the minds of those who loved the digital pioneer. Made in 1961, the video above states that this is his “demo reel: work created with his analog computer/film camera magic machine he built from a WWII anti-aircraft gun sight. Also Whitney and the techniques he developed with this machine were what inspired Douglas Trumbull (special fx wizard) to use the slit scan technique on 2001: A Space Oddessey.” </p>
