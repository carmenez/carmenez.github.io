<p>Prompt:live without google</p>
<p>First I thought this was simple.  Throw the phone away. I’ve done it before, I love doing it, and the addiction to the digital pet we call our iphones is really annoying. Letting go of my attachment to my devices is like letting the dog off the leash.  It may run in to traffic and die or in our cases as ‘digital media artists’ destroy potential career opportunities becuase we didn’t respond to that company that wanted to hire us…but what is the price you will pay for freedom? </p>
<p>So, I started looking around the internet, searching for alternatives that won’t use my data to sculpt my internet experience.  Well, it turns out, most of the sites that I frequent…use google, have been acquired by google, or are made by google.<br>So, what are these you ask?<br>Here’s the shortlist: google search, google maps, gmail, youtube, google calendar, google groups, google drive, google translate, google docs &amp; google hangouts.<br>Here’s the long list: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_mergers_and_acquisitions_by_Alphabet" target="_blank" rel="external"> Acquired by Alphabet</a></p>
<p>What does this make me feel? well, google can delete me. they have access to all of my information &amp; they reserve the right to delete my account, at any time, for any reason, with or without notice.  This means: my calendar, my precious documents, my google phone number, my favorite youtube videos!!  I really need the search engine, since I am always watching tutorials, the email makes my life much easier + the interface is user friendly &amp; easy to use…especially when I have to troubleshoot with my mom (who, btw, is a rockstar internetter). </p>
<p>So in this exercise:</p>
<p>for internet browsing ——-<br>I will have to switch my default web browser.If I had my choice, my next preference is Firefox, but i can’t use that, or opera.  So…safari? Nope. Begrudgingly i can use bing or yahoo…but actually they are just as big and don’t mind my privacy! so my final option is: duck duck go- but i’m usig it through chrome, so i’m using google anyway, right? Well at least i’m not being tracked…my other options include Quora, Dogpile, Yandex [from russia], ixquick,</p>
<p>for video —-<br>vimeo </p>
<p>for music —–<br>soundcloud</p>
<p>for maps—–<br>HERE Maps + get lost &amp; ask people questions</p>
<p>&amp;&amp;<br>to get less googled:<br>disable location tracking<br>opt out of data tracking</p>
<ul>
<li>Good Luck</li>
</ul>

<p>Prompt: Create an autonomous online network</p>
<p>Well, what is an autonomous network?</p>
<p>A Rhizome is: a continuously growing horizontal underground stem that puts out lateral shoots and adventitious roots at intervals. </p>
<p>An autonomous network allows the users to deflect “normal” networking systems. I decided to create an autonomous network for the MTA riders.  Having been part of the design and maintenance of Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART) and a public transit rider, I have experienced the “unknown delay.” Often I think about how the underground experience is without internet, and its users have  to depend on the train conductor to get information about the status of our charriot. What is happening? How long will we be here? Can I take another change? NO SIGNAL, results in confused, aggrivated, and unhappy commuters.  </p>
<p>What if a [mesh] network could exist so individuals could get real time information from somewhere above the water table.  If a train has been stopped for more than 10 minutes, an autonomous network would appear and allow us to find out from news sources if there has been a malfunction, an attack, any issue that has caused the infrastructure to stop performing and alert us to alternatives on how to move around, giving us control of our commute.</p>

<p>John whitney used mathematics and analog machines to bend the minds of those who loved the digital pioneer. Made in 1961, the video above states that this is his “demo reel: work created with his analog computer/film camera magic machine he built from a WWII anti-aircraft gun sight. Also Whitney and the techniques he developed with this machine were what inspired Douglas Trumbull (special fx wizard) to use the slit scan technique on 2001: A Space Oddessey.” </p>

<p>155 Bank St – WestBeth once the Bell Telephone Laboratories (between 1898 and 1966) now a building for Artists and The School for Poetic Computation is an industrial complex. Brick exterior and welcoming public spaces leave its visitors feeling like they are visiting an oasis in the west village.  as we are studying within a complex that influenced, transformed and developed modern day technology. –<a href="http://ethw.org/Bell_Labs" target="_blank" rel="external">http://ethw.org/Bell_Labs</a><br>Claude Shannon – 1916-2001- After graduating in 1936, Shannon went directly to MIT to take up a work-study position he had seen advertised on a postcard tacked to a campus bulletin board…</p>
<p>This was a man who would explore machine learning in the 1940’s.  A researcher who “demonstrated the essential unity of all information media, pointing out that text, telephone signals, radio waves, pictures, film and every other mode of communication could be encoded in the universal language of binary digits, or bits-a term that his article was the first to use in print.” A man who would go on to publish, develop, and push the technology of the modern time.</p>
<p>So, what was on the card that gave him a reason to start working at Bell Labs? Was it a graphic? Was he in need for money and going to take the first job he could get? What was the visual vernacular? How did graphic artists explain technology?</p>
<p>I saw Megan Prelinger speak at Grey Area and discuss the graphic design in early technology.  the early radio, telephone, and electricity companies in the United States were shown to the public through a graphic language. Technology and graphic design grew together through two mediums: trade literature and science fiction.  Prelinger states that visual images were used to attract budding engineers by advertising utopian worlds through a scientific lens.  Circuit schematic symbols were used in the begenning of design and art with electronics.  Begenning with simplified lines &amp; form in the 1950’s then moving to numbers binary.</p>

A friendly code master he introduced us to the Demoscene, a meet up for people who like to compete and show their computational skills.<br>We started his class learning about some of his work and jumped into playing around with some of the code he has written. We first talked about:</p>

<p>Face++ started from SnapChat.  We were swapping faces and noticed that there were a few facial recognition commands that the application recognized. We decided to expand our language from a – “Open your mouth” and “Raise your eyebrows” – to 16 different facial expressions.<br>We decided to figure out a way to write a programming language that would run on laughter.  You can write using your face and once you’ve created your code, trigger laughter to compile and run it.  Melanie pointed out that this would actually be a great programming language for people with disabilities, more specifically targeting those who are paralyzed from the neck down.</p>

<p>Some other really beautiful coding languages were created.  Melanie translated a simple, “helloWorld” to 7 of the most common languages. And Max created a mobile to hang above your babies crib so your child can get familiar with coding(?). KristaAnn created a programming language from Tarot Cards, and Min created instructions for programmers. (i think)</p>
