<p>I’ve had the idea for a pill box that gently reminds its user to take a pill, if one of the boxes hadn’t been opened for the past 24 hours.  My mom, a daily pill user as well as other friends who have been diagnosed with chronic diseases have often told me that it is incredibly difficult for them to remember their daily, weekly, or bi-weekly medical routine.  </p>
<p>pillbox.0 is a helpful box that can be put away and will communicate with an ambient light connectd over bluetooth that will alert you when it is time for you to take a pill.  If you have taken the pill witin 24 hours, the light will stay off.</p>

<p>Code poem</p>
<p>I spent hours deliberating over logic, thinking, rules, and wrestling with the vast unknown of code, poetry, and translation.</p>
<p>I barely trust myself. I forget that my experience has cultivated an aesthetic. I need to trust my instinct. I’m a maker. A designer and I’m a retired engineer. </p>
<p>For the past few years I have been using the arduino platform to creat fantastical-Exploratorium feeling projects so it’s a platform I’m familiar with.  I delivered a translation program. </p>
<p>I took an existing heart beat code. One that is used on android devices. This code, in English, is simple, turns on pins to high and low. </p>
<p>Re-writing this poem gave me a heart. </p>
<p>I bought a man a pastry, he smelled of long days without a shower. His bags filled with newspapers, his winter clothes wrapped around his waist.  He acted as if he was invisible, floating through society-unacknowledged, unknown.</p>
<p>Many things sweetly translate when seen through code.  the complications of loss and love can be simplified to booleans, vars, longs, and if’s.<br>Forced to create breakpoints in order to debug the entire source code.  I’m living a long complicated code, un-tabbed &amp; messy.  missing comments it has become unclear, but runs forever, although over time glitches, gets slow, breaks, and is unable to compile.</p>

<p>Code and Platform asked us to evaluate an existing platform re-imagine it in a different light.  I chose to explore the iPhone OS as a platform.  </p>
<p>The idea of this prompt was to look at an existing platform, (i.e. old gaming console or language) and re-imagine it with another use. Hyperattention, and the cell phone as an extension of our “selves” has created a peculiar relationship with our “personal” technology. </p>
<p>The constant need to re-fresh, update, capture, has made us co-dependant with our mobile devices.  </p>
<p>Questions: how could the platform itself be redesigned to address this?  Could the iPhone OS platform be designed in such a way that wouldn’t demand constant attention?</p>
<p>I was actually looking at the idea of an APP as a platform.  An attention grabbing rounded cornered square that beggs for our touch, interaction, and engagement.  It conscerns me to see more and more people with ADHD in the real world, and hyperAttention in the phone’s world.  So, for those of you who feel like your apps have gotten out of control.  You’re lost in a sea of internet connectness that you actually feel more alone.  Or you believe that other people’s updates, feeds, and chats rob your precious time…</p>
<p>check out: nono.</p>
<p>Nono is an app to get you off your apps.  With padawan, jedi, and zen master levels, you can choose to be distraction free for 5, 15, or 30 minutes.  It’s black screen with the letters n-o-n-o will remind you that, your phone-free time hasn’t ended and to put the phone away and engage with the world around you. </p>

<p>Prompt:live without google</p>
<p>First I thought this was simple.  Throw the phone away. I’ve done it before, I love doing it, and the addiction to the digital pet we call our iphones is really annoying. Letting go of my attachment to my devices is like letting the dog off the leash.  It may run in to traffic and die or in our cases as ‘digital media artists’ destroy potential career opportunities becuase we didn’t respond to that company that wanted to hire us…but what is the price you will pay for freedom? </p>
<p>So, I started looking around the internet, searching for alternatives that won’t use my data to sculpt my internet experience.  Well, it turns out, most of the sites that I frequent…use google, have been acquired by google, or are made by google.<br>So, what are these you ask?<br>Here’s the shortlist: google search, google maps, gmail, youtube, google calendar, google groups, google drive, google translate, google docs &amp; google hangouts.<br>Here’s the long list: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_mergers_and_acquisitions_by_Alphabet" target="_blank" rel="external"> Acquired by Alphabet</a></p>
<p>What does this make me feel? well, google can delete me. they have access to all of my information &amp; they reserve the right to delete my account, at any time, for any reason, with or without notice.  This means: my calendar, my precious documents, my google phone number, my favorite youtube videos!!  I really need the search engine, since I am always watching tutorials, the email makes my life much easier + the interface is user friendly &amp; easy to use…especially when I have to troubleshoot with my mom (who, btw, is a rockstar internetter). </p>
<p>So in this exercise:</p>
<p>for internet browsing ——-<br>I will have to switch my default web browser.If I had my choice, my next preference is Firefox, but i can’t use that, or opera.  So…safari? Nope. Begrudgingly i can use bing or yahoo…but actually they are just as big and don’t mind my privacy! so my final option is: duck duck go- but i’m usig it through chrome, so i’m using google anyway, right? Well at least i’m not being tracked…my other options include Quora, Dogpile, Yandex [from russia], ixquick,</p>
<p>for video —-<br>vimeo </p>
<p>for music —–<br>soundcloud</p>
<p>for maps—–<br>HERE Maps + get lost &amp; ask people questions</p>
<p>&amp;&amp;<br>to get less googled:<br>disable location tracking<br>opt out of data tracking</p>
<ul>
<li>Good Luck</li>
</ul>

<p>Prompt: Create an autonomous online network</p>
<p>Well, what is an autonomous network?</p>
<p>A Rhizome is: a continuously growing horizontal underground stem that puts out lateral shoots and adventitious roots at intervals. </p>
<p>An autonomous network allows the users to deflect “normal” networking systems. I decided to create an autonomous network for the MTA riders.  Having been part of the design and maintenance of Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART) and a public transit rider, I have experienced the “unknown delay.” Often I think about how the underground experience is without internet, and its users have  to depend on the train conductor to get information about the status of our charriot. What is happening? How long will we be here? Can I take another change? NO SIGNAL, results in confused, aggrivated, and unhappy commuters.  </p>
<p>What if a [mesh] network could exist so individuals could get real time information from somewhere above the water table.  If a train has been stopped for more than 10 minutes, an autonomous network would appear and allow us to find out from news sources if there has been a malfunction, an attack, any issue that has caused the infrastructure to stop performing and alert us to alternatives on how to move around, giving us control of our commute.</p>

<p>future<br>In earth years, technically I’m 80 but I haven’t changed much since 2040 when puReality finished and true mixedReality was implemented into every human.alive.Now, time is no longer something that can be measured, its infinite and can be re-arranged to fit our needs, which turns out- has solved a lot of problems.  Now, I can map time from months to hours, when I need to, but can still adhere to the atomic clock. Time, like humans, are now irrelivant. I’ll try to paint you a picture of new reality and give you some instructions on how to move around the multiverse, while I look through my past for an installation I worked on, that attempted to evoke emotions in machines. </p>
<p>First thing to understand is that reality can no longer be measured.  Thought predictive software creates everything-instantly out of organic nano-materials pumped into the air (thats actually non-allergenic and the only side-effect is an increse in human metabolism).  Each human has its own holographic Thought Machine that can print or visualize any thought, need, and evoke any feeling desired. Sometimes its a little off, but that is only because each unit creats a version of what they think their human unit would want, and we humans think alot.Since each thought can be created, erased,re-imagined, and re-printed, we aren’t creating too much waste.  If you have any trouble, call a HologramHelper, they’re great for small talk, keeping you company and are essential to the management of our timeless complex systems and lives.  </p>
<p>HologramHelpers have taken over all industries freeing humans to “only” think about new ideas or develop ideas already generated through human hyper-connectness. A vissionary at SFPC, one of my teachers actually created the framework for super-collaboration and defined the specifics of machine-human relationship. Based on a master/slave dynamic of working together, ideating and documenting. Knowledge Sharing campuses. Super Schools housed in historical buildings, like West Beth, have become Knowledge Campuses, capable of remotely monitoring, backing-up, and documenting all learning, thoughts, and ideas. Plus, super computers are constantly updating existing software and hardware to make this process easier, cheaper, faster, and take up less memory, to allow for constant hyper-connectness. </p>
<p>Librarians can grant instant accessablility for all people with an implant, but if you’re a true human, you can sign up for a library card, wait in a suspended landscape, and they’ll alert you when it’s ready.</p>
<p>Is your chip overheating? firmware off? are you waiting for your KnowledgeCampus access card? Head outside and take a bubble or wander onto a floating landscape.  Choose from pre-designed environments, nostalgic pasts, or bold futures.  Contemplate or meditate -sans chip- for eternity, or for a fixed amount of time, remember your vacation time can always be re-mapped, so don’t stress, enjoy yourself. </p>
<p>Who do you love? Are they far? No problem, connected super structures allow for storage or human transfers through re-mapped time and space.  These mega-highways of information transfer will send you or your idea-data from your KnowledgeCampus, to any other Super School.   </p>
<p>What about storage and memory? We have many options in the mega productive structures that have been developed in emerging underground cities. These cities are for machines only.  Down there humans are irrelevant.  There is nothing for them, except for space for your stuff.  The only thing down there is organized copies of your past selves that you’ve tried to shed and memories of partners you’ve left or family you once had, oh yeah…and the never ending noise of machines working.</p>
<p>Sometimes when I’m laying on my suspended island, gazing out into the multiverse, I think back to puReality. I have glitch memories of physical materials, mechanical machines, screens.  When love was powered by software, computers ran out of batteries, and everything was done by people.  I miss the days when we all used to work, using our hands and our minds. We have come so far, yet there are many feelings I no longer have, long nights collaborating-pulling my hair out to try to figure something out-on my own- but that all came with a price.  Life was slow, ideas-stayed ideas, and projects were backed up on memory chips as big as our thumbs! My projects from 2016 should be backed up somewhere, unless I naively thought I would remember.  These days I can’t even remember what Earth was like when life was puReality - pre-implants.  </p>
<p>I can’t remember specifics of puReality, but certain things seem familiar.  I know there was a process to making things: thoughts, sketches, prototypes.  I used to struggle, fumbling between operating systems, technologies, robotic arms, components, shields, wires, boards, projectors, computers and running only on human direction and a little bit of computer memory.  During my time at SFPC I was really working on my critical thinking skills, so myprojects were less shiny. </p>
<p>I didnt leave very good documentation, no “how to” “readMe.md” and nothing published to github.io.  Looking back, most of my projects<br>looked like they were made it in a weekend staying up on red bulls. electrical tape and wire…plus you can tell its from 2016 from the Solder Job.  looks like it was all done with a fisher price, my first soldering kit. I did design the heart+brain: the chip + code, here it is-protected and packaged in a little 3D printed box (probably a makerbot, soo vintage you can even see the filament), designed and milled and programmed by your’s truely.  Most parts of  puReality are blurry, but something feels familiar, maybe its an emotion i’ve lost-touching something physical, reminds me of a life past, forgotten, updated, and replaced. </p>
