<p>I’ve had the idea for a pill box that gently reminds its user to take a pill, if one of the boxes hadn’t been opened for the past 24 hours.  My mom, a daily pill user as well as other friends who have been diagnosed with chronic diseases have often told me that it is incredibly difficult for them to remember their daily, weekly, or bi-weekly medical routine.  </p>
<p>pillbox.0 is a helpful box that can be put away and will communicate with an ambient light connectd over bluetooth that will alert you when it is time for you to take a pill.  If you have taken the pill witin 24 hours, the light will stay off.</p>

<p>Code poem</p>
<p>I spent hours deliberating over logic, thinking, rules, and wrestling with the vast unknown of code, poetry, and translation.</p>
<p>I barely trust myself. I forget that my experience has cultivated an aesthetic. I need to trust my instinct. I’m a maker. A designer and I’m a retired engineer. </p>
<p>For the past few years I have been using the arduino platform to creat fantastical-Exploratorium feeling projects so it’s a platform I’m familiar with.  I delivered a translation program. </p>
<p>I took an existing heart beat code. One that is used on android devices. This code, in English, is simple, turns on pins to high and low. </p>
<p>Re-writing this poem gave me a heart. </p>
<p>I bought a man a pastry, he smelled of long days without a shower. His bags filled with newspapers, his winter clothes wrapped around his waist.  He acted as if he was invisible, floating through society-unacknowledged, unknown.</p>
<p>Many things sweetly translate when seen through code.  the complications of loss and love can be simplified to booleans, vars, longs, and if’s.<br>Forced to create breakpoints in order to debug the entire source code.  I’m living a long complicated code, un-tabbed &amp; messy.  missing comments it has become unclear, but runs forever, although over time glitches, gets slow, breaks, and is unable to compile.</p>

<p>Code and Platform asked us to evaluate an existing platform re-imagine it in a different light.  I chose to explore the iPhone OS as a platform.  </p>
<p>The idea of this prompt was to look at an existing platform, (i.e. old gaming console or language) and re-imagine it with another use. Hyperattention, and the cell phone as an extension of our “selves” has created a peculiar relationship with our “personal” technology. </p>
<p>The constant need to re-fresh, update, capture, has made us co-dependant with our mobile devices.  </p>
<p>Questions: how could the platform itself be redesigned to address this?  Could the iPhone OS platform be designed in such a way that wouldn’t demand constant attention?</p>
<p>I was actually looking at the idea of an APP as a platform.  An attention grabbing rounded cornered square that beggs for our touch, interaction, and engagement.  It conscerns me to see more and more people with ADHD in the real world, and hyperAttention in the phone’s world.  So, for those of you who feel like your apps have gotten out of control.  You’re lost in a sea of internet connectness that you actually feel more alone.  Or you believe that other people’s updates, feeds, and chats rob your precious time…</p>
<p>check out: nono.</p>
<p>Nono is an app to get you off your apps.  With padawan, jedi, and zen master levels, you can choose to be distraction free for 5, 15, or 30 minutes.  It’s black screen with the letters n-o-n-o will remind you that, your phone-free time hasn’t ended and to put the phone away and engage with the world around you. </p>

<p>Prompt:live without google</p>
<p>First I thought this was simple.  Throw the phone away. I’ve done it before, I love doing it, and the addiction to the digital pet we call our iphones is really annoying. Letting go of my attachment to my devices is like letting the dog off the leash.  It may run in to traffic and die or in our cases as ‘digital media artists’ destroy potential career opportunities becuase we didn’t respond to that company that wanted to hire us…but what is the price you will pay for freedom? </p>
<p>So, I started looking around the internet, searching for alternatives that won’t use my data to sculpt my internet experience.  Well, it turns out, most of the sites that I frequent…use google, have been acquired by google, or are made by google.<br>So, what are these you ask?<br>Here’s the shortlist: google search, google maps, gmail, youtube, google calendar, google groups, google drive, google translate, google docs &amp; google hangouts.<br>Here’s the long list: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_mergers_and_acquisitions_by_Alphabet" target="_blank" rel="external"> Acquired by Alphabet</a></p>
<p>What does this make me feel? well, google can delete me. they have access to all of my information &amp; they reserve the right to delete my account, at any time, for any reason, with or without notice.  This means: my calendar, my precious documents, my google phone number, my favorite youtube videos!!  I really need the search engine, since I am always watching tutorials, the email makes my life much easier + the interface is user friendly &amp; easy to use…especially when I have to troubleshoot with my mom (who, btw, is a rockstar internetter). </p>
<p>So in this exercise:</p>
<p>for internet browsing ——-<br>I will have to switch my default web browser.If I had my choice, my next preference is Firefox, but i can’t use that, or opera.  So…safari? Nope. Begrudgingly i can use bing or yahoo…but actually they are just as big and don’t mind my privacy! so my final option is: duck duck go- but i’m usig it through chrome, so i’m using google anyway, right? Well at least i’m not being tracked…my other options include Quora, Dogpile, Yandex [from russia], ixquick,</p>
<p>for video —-<br>vimeo </p>
<p>for music —–<br>soundcloud</p>
<p>for maps—–<br>HERE Maps + get lost &amp; ask people questions</p>
<p>&amp;&amp;<br>to get less googled:<br>disable location tracking<br>opt out of data tracking</p>
<ul>
<li>Good Luck</li>
</ul>
