<p>Creating Binary Games was really challenging fun.  Individuals moved between systems for teaching binary as well as tools for quick conversion of binary numbers to base 10 numbers.  Min and I came up with Binary Stairs, a combination of twister and musical chairs.  In this 2 player game, the values of each bit are placed on a stair.  Anyone calls out a number or binary code and you have to touch each bit that represents the base 10 number or binary pattern. Nahee and brandon each came up with a great ways to teach binary using a rescuing scenario board game and a measured representations of the bits to get their corresponding bit pattern.</p>

<p>these words reminds me of a functioning 22nd century city- maybe an electric city with radiant atmospheres.  I could even imagine this city as a virtual model with integrated sensors aka. people called capacitors.  The rebels, who want to mix reality are the resistors.  but the motherboard doesn’t like the symbol of freedom so they are taken to the batteries via I/O busses driven by wifi memory conductors to be processed.  high temperatures spilling blood and light out of usbs installed on resistor wrists.   high fans built of metal cool silicon and copper models being made by capacitors.  only 10110110 11010111 left.</p>

<h3 id="interview-with-claude-shannon"><a href="#interview-with-claude-shannon" class="headerlink" title="interview with claude shannon"></a>interview with claude shannon</h3><p>Claude Shannon:<br>[telling a story about Alan Turing]</p>
<p>So I asked him what he was doing.<br>And he said he was trying to find a way to get better feedback from a computer so he would know what was going on inside the computer.<br>And he’d invented this wonderful command.<br>See, in those days they were working with individual commands.<br>And the idea was to discover good commands.<br>And I said, what is the command? And he said, the command is put a pulse to the hooter, put a pulse to the hooter.<br>Now let me translate that.<br>A hooter is an English, in England is a loudspeaker.<br>And by putting a pulse to it, it would just be put a pulse to a hooter.<br>Now what good is this crazy command?<br>Well, the good of this command is that if you’re in a loop you can have this command in that loop<br>and every time it goes around the loop it will put a pulse in and you will hear a frequency equal to<br>how long it takes to go around that loop. And then you can put another one in some bigger loop and so on.<br>And so you’ll hear all of this coming on and you’ll hear this “boo boo boo boo boo boo,”[CS vocalizing in a sing-song fashion]<br>and his concept was that you would soon learn to listen to that and know whether when it got hung up in a loop or something else or what<br>it was doing all this time, which he’d never been able to tell before.<br>That was a great idea, but I don’t think it was really a very good idea.<br>That command seems to have disappeared from the vocabulary.

<h3 id="COMPUTING-MACHINERY-AND-INTELLIGENCE"><a href="#COMPUTING-MACHINERY-AND-INTELLIGENCE" class="headerlink" title="COMPUTING MACHINERY AND INTELLIGENCE"></a>COMPUTING MACHINERY AND INTELLIGENCE</h3><p>By A. M. Turing (an excerpt)</p>
<p>The short answer to this argument is that although it is established that there are<br>limitations to the Powers of any particular machine, it has only been stated, without<br>any sort of proof, that no such limitations apply to the human intellect. But I do not<br>think this view can be dismissed quite so lightly. Whenever one of these machines<br>is asked the appropriate critical question, and gives a definite answer, we know that<br>this answer must be wrong, and this gives us a certain feeling of superiority. Is this<br>feeling illusory? It is no doubt quite genuine, but I do not think too much<br>importance should be attached to it. We too often give wrong answers to questions<br>ourselves to be justified in being very pleased at such evidence of fallibility on the<br>part of the machines. Further, our superiority can only be felt on such an occasion<br>in relation to the one machine over which we have scored our petty triumph. There<br>would be no question of triumphing simultaneously over all machines. In short,<br>then, there might be men cleverer than any given machine, but then again there<br>might be other machines cleverer again, and so on</p>

<p>Day 2.  I’m getting used to a longer commute, I can usually read one (maaayyybbbeee 2) pages over and over about 4-6 times from the Morgan stop on the L to 14th.  I get distracted by all the New Yorkers shuttled around in little tin cans coming, going, and hosting all sorts.  The metro doesn’t discriminate.</p>
<p>This week is full of ice-breaking, bonding, and drawing.  One of the most exciting things is that CLASS STARTED ON TIME! wow. It’s great to be part of a community that cares about their experience enough that they actively make an effort to participate.  It is encouraging to see my piers as well as my teachers at sfpc and ready at the time they said they would be.</p>

<p>Human Fax Machine + Simple Rules Drawings.  Zach asked us to participate in a few exercises that got us thinking like computers.  In human fax machine, we were asked to communicate through sound.  to do this one must create a protocol for converting drawings into sound.  Then, define rules for sending and receiving in order to transform information from one language to another.  We started with directional representations and their sounds(up(mount sound)/down(heavy hand on table)/left(flick on the table)/right(scratch the table)) + (pause//clap) Then we established a set of rules. 1. sound out coordinates (x,y) on the page, when complete, pause. 2. draw a unit of line for each sound representation heard. 3. pause when complete.  This was a really interesting way of defining rules and the importance of being specific.  Although the rules were specific, it was difficult for us to translate the sounds to images.  There was a lot of thinking, eyebrow furrowing, and starting over.<br>Drawing got us to follow simple rules that allowed us to generate without thinking.  The goal was to be fill up a big sheet of paper quickly by turning the rules into a drawing.</p>

<p>Exercise 1: start by drawing a straight line at any length, angle, and position.  Next line can only be drawing on previous lines &amp; no crossing.</p>
<p>Exercise 2: Fill the circle to make it perfect.</p>
<p>Exercise 3: Make your own rules: draw 90 degree arcs in any direction.  Next arc must be offset a few units from any arc and drawing in any direction on any point on the line.</p>
<p>I really loved this exercise.</p>
<p>I also did my own interpertations</p>

What topics are best for new media art?  What is practical cryptology? How does creativity in the process–shape our life experience? How do I make the process a project? to manage and FINISH projects? How about making this a business? How do I openframeworks?
