<p>Face++ started from SnapChat.  We were swapping faces and noticed that there were a few facial recognition commands that the application recognized. We decided to expand our language from a – “Open your mouth” and “Raise your eyebrows” – to 16 different facial expressions.<br>We decided to figure out a way to write a programming language that would run on laughter.  You can write using your face and once you’ve created your code, trigger laughter to compile and run it.  Melanie pointed out that this would actually be a great programming language for people with disabilities, more specifically targeting those who are paralyzed from the neck down.</p>

<p>Experimenting a little bit with the code, we switched in some images from the Codex Seraphinianus to generate some beautiful tiling patterns, resulting in the featured image.</p>

<p>Some other really beautiful coding languages were created.  Melanie translated a simple, “helloWorld” to 7 of the most common languages. And Max created a mobile to hang above your babies crib so your child can get familiar with coding(?). KristaAnn created a programming language from Tarot Cards, and Min created instructions for programmers. (i think)</p>

<p>We didn’t have class today, but we got to see some amazing speakers as well as spend some time in the space.</p>
<p>As I am looking over my notes these are the things that stand out to me:<br>Be Agressively Curious</p>

<p>Creating Binary Games was really challenging fun.  Individuals moved between systems for teaching binary as well as tools for quick conversion of binary numbers to base 10 numbers.  Min and I came up with Binary Stairs, a combination of twister and musical chairs.  In this 2 player game, the values of each bit are placed on a stair.  Anyone calls out a number or binary code and you have to touch each bit that represents the base 10 number or binary pattern. Nahee and brandon each came up with a great ways to teach binary using a rescuing scenario board game and a measured representations of the bits to get their corresponding bit pattern.</p>

<p>Programming: lets discuss and demystify.  Just talking vocabulary…</p>
<p>what is computation? Numbers? Computers? Processes that solve and translate? here are our thoughts.</p>
<p>:: input/output :: symbols :: memory :: usb :: processor [cpu] :: sensors [keyboard &amp; mouse] :: output [screen] :: I/O busses :: wifi :: conductive :: abstraction/modeling :: metal :: silicon :: copper :: fans :: temperature :: capacitors :: resistors :: batteries :: lights :: motherboard :: electricity ::</p>
<p>these words reminds me of a functioning 22nd century city- maybe an electric city with radiant atmospheres.  I could even imagine this city as a virtual model with integrated sensors aka. people called capacitors.  The rebels, who want to mix reality are the resistors.  but the motherboard doesn’t like the symbol of freedom so they are taken to the batteries via I/O busses driven by wifi memory conductors to be processed.  high temperatures spilling blood and light out of usbs installed on resistor wrists.   high fans built of metal cool silicon and copper models being made by capacitors.  only 10110110 11010111 left.</p>

<p>I guess thats an accurate representation of my brain-short tangential distractions welcome.</p>
