<p>155 Bank St – WestBeth once the Bell Telephone Laboratories (between 1898 and 1966) now a building for Artists and The School for Poetic Computation is an industrial complex. Brick exterior and welcoming public spaces leave its visitors feeling like they are visiting an oasis in the west village.  as we are studying within a complex that influenced, transformed and developed modern day technology. –<a href="http://ethw.org/Bell_Labs" target="_blank" rel="external">http://ethw.org/Bell_Labs</a><br>Claude Shannon – 1916-2001- After graduating in 1936, Shannon went directly to MIT to take up a work-study position he had seen advertised on a postcard tacked to a campus bulletin board…</p>
<p>This was a man who would explore machine learning in the 1940’s.  A researcher who “demonstrated the essential unity of all information media, pointing out that text, telephone signals, radio waves, pictures, film and every other mode of communication could be encoded in the universal language of binary digits, or bits-a term that his article was the first to use in print.” A man who would go on to publish, develop, and push the technology of the modern time.</p>
<p>So, what was on the card that gave him a reason to start working at Bell Labs? Was it a graphic? Was he in need for money and going to take the first job he could get? What was the visual vernacular? How did graphic artists explain technology?</p>
<p>I saw Megan Prelinger speak at Grey Area and discuss the graphic design in early technology.  the early radio, telephone, and electricity companies in the United States were shown to the public through a graphic language. Technology and graphic design grew together through two mediums: trade literature and science fiction.  Prelinger states that visual images were used to attract budding engineers by advertising utopian worlds through a scientific lens.  Circuit schematic symbols were used in the begenning of design and art with electronics.  Begenning with simplified lines &amp; form in the 1950’s then moving to numbers binary.</p>

<p>John whitney used mathematics and analog machines to bend the minds of those who loved the digital pioneer. Made in 1961, the video above states that this is his “demo reel: work created with his analog computer/film camera magic machine he built from a WWII anti-aircraft gun sight. Also Whitney and the techniques he developed with this machine were what inspired Douglas Trumbull (special fx wizard) to use the slit scan technique on 2001: A Space Oddessey.” </p>

<p>Face++ started from SnapChat.  We were swapping faces and noticed that there were a few facial recognition commands that the application recognized. We decided to expand our language from a – “Open your mouth” and “Raise your eyebrows” – to 16 different facial expressions.<br>We decided to figure out a way to write a programming language that would run on laughter.  You can write using your face and once you’ve created your code, trigger laughter to compile and run it.  Melanie pointed out that this would actually be a great programming language for people with disabilities, more specifically targeting those who are paralyzed from the neck down.</p>

<p>Experimenting a little bit with the code, we switched in some images from the Codex Seraphinianus to generate some beautiful tiling patterns, resulting in the featured image.</p>

<p>Some other really beautiful coding languages were created.  Melanie translated a simple, “helloWorld” to 7 of the most common languages. And Max created a mobile to hang above your babies crib so your child can get familiar with coding(?). KristaAnn created a programming language from Tarot Cards, and Min created instructions for programmers. (i think)</p>

<p>Creating Binary Games was really challenging fun.  Individuals moved between systems for teaching binary as well as tools for quick conversion of binary numbers to base 10 numbers.  Min and I came up with Binary Stairs, a combination of twister and musical chairs.  In this 2 player game, the values of each bit are placed on a stair.  Anyone calls out a number or binary code and you have to touch each bit that represents the base 10 number or binary pattern. Nahee and brandon each came up with a great ways to teach binary using a rescuing scenario board game and a measured representations of the bits to get their corresponding bit pattern.</p>

<p>Programming: lets discuss and demystify.  Just talking vocabulary…</p>
<p>what is computation? Numbers? Computers? Processes that solve and translate? here are our thoughts.</p>
<p>:: input/output :: symbols :: memory :: usb :: processor [cpu] :: sensors [keyboard &amp; mouse] :: output [screen] :: I/O busses :: wifi :: conductive :: abstraction/modeling :: metal :: silicon :: copper :: fans :: temperature :: capacitors :: resistors :: batteries :: lights :: motherboard :: electricity ::</p>
<p>these words reminds me of a functioning 22nd century city- maybe an electric city with radiant atmospheres.  I could even imagine this city as a virtual model with integrated sensors aka. people called capacitors.  The rebels, who want to mix reality are the resistors.  but the motherboard doesn’t like the symbol of freedom so they are taken to the batteries via I/O busses driven by wifi memory conductors to be processed.  high temperatures spilling blood and light out of usbs installed on resistor wrists.   high fans built of metal cool silicon and copper models being made by capacitors.  only 10110110 11010111 left.</p>

<p>Day 2.  I’m getting used to a longer commute, I can usually read one (maaayyybbbeee 2) pages over and over about 4-6 times from the Morgan stop on the L to 14th.  I get distracted by all the New Yorkers shuttled around in little tin cans coming, going, and hosting all sorts.  The metro doesn’t discriminate.</p>
<p>This week is full of ice-breaking, bonding, and drawing.  One of the most exciting things is that CLASS STARTED ON TIME! wow. It’s great to be part of a community that cares about their experience enough that they actively make an effort to participate.  It is encouraging to see my piers as well as my teachers at sfpc and ready at the time they said they would be.</p>

<p>Human Fax Machine + Simple Rules Drawings.  Zach asked us to participate in a few exercises that got us thinking like computers.  In human fax machine, we were asked to communicate through sound.  to do this one must create a protocol for converting drawings into sound.  Then, define rules for sending and receiving in order to transform information from one language to another.  We started with directional representations and their sounds(up(mount sound)/down(heavy hand on table)/left(flick on the table)/right(scratch the table)) + (pause//clap) Then we established a set of rules. 1. sound out coordinates (x,y) on the page, when complete, pause. 2. draw a unit of line for each sound representation heard. 3. pause when complete.  This was a really interesting way of defining rules and the importance of being specific.  Although the rules were specific, it was difficult for us to translate the sounds to images.  There was a lot of thinking, eyebrow furrowing, and starting over.<br>Drawing got us to follow simple rules that allowed us to generate without thinking.  The goal was to be fill up a big sheet of paper quickly by turning the rules into a drawing.</p>

<p>Exercise 1: start by drawing a straight line at any length, angle, and position.  Next line can only be drawing on previous lines &amp; no crossing.</p>
<p>Exercise 2: Fill the circle to make it perfect.</p>
<p>Exercise 3: Make your own rules: draw 90 degree arcs in any direction.  Next arc must be offset a few units from any arc and drawing in any direction on any point on the line.</p>
<p>I really loved this exercise.</p>
<p>I also did my own interpertations</p>

<p>what insights curiosity? self ignition? How can we engage “hands-free”? How can I bring the SFPC pedagogy {i learned a new word}  to life/career/institutions? What are important questions to ask when making interactive art? How do you decide the scale? How do you make interactive art’s tech reliable? hardware? software? How much do technical skills matter? What topics are best for new media art?  What is practical cryptology? How does creativity in the process–shape our life experience? How do I make the process a project? to manage and FINISH projects? How about making this a business? How do I openframeworks? How can I incorporate code art on the digital platform into or translate it to the physical object or experience? How do I make experiences that everyone can/wants to engage in?<br>sfpc Code of Conduct [do’s &amp; dont’s] +we met dan shiffman! 01001111 01001101 01000111 !!</p>
