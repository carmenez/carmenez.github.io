inspired by the distance from my family, my friends, and my lovers.

we_walk is a triptych. a narrative describing the synchroneity of life in phase with another and the turbulence experienced through seperation of space and time.  push and turn knobs to move each character, confined within their screens they walk and tell you their story.
