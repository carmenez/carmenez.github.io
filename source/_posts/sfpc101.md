&mdash;The space ship has docked, I met the other life forms that will be attending the school for poetic computation for the next 10 weeks with me. output:  clear, concise, art and code.&mdash; 16 new humans!


<a href="http://i.imgur.com/fYrDP3E.png">
<img style="margin-bottom: 5px" src="http://i.imgur.com/fYrDP3E.png"/></a>we asked questions, some of mine were:

what insights curiosity? self ignition? How can we engage “hands-free”? How can I bring the SFPC pedagogy {i learned a new word}  to life/career/institutions? What are important questions to ask when making interactive art? How do you decide the scale? How do you make interactive art’s tech reliable? hardware? software? How much do technical skills matter? What topics are best for new media art?  What is practical cryptology? How does creativity in the process–shape our life experience? How do I make the process a project? to manage and FINISH projects? How about making this a business? How do I openframeworks? How can I incorporate code art on the digital platform into or translate it to the physical object or experience? How do I make experiences that everyone can/wants to engage in?
