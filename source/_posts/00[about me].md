Hello.

I'm carmen. I like low-high technology, beautiful, engaging experiences, and am currently a director of creative technology at Hyphen-Labs. I'm a thinker, designer, maker, and connector.  I am taking over the multiverse one planet at a time.  I am from the rings of saturn and look forward to showing you my side of the galaxy.  To see more info check out  <a href="www.hyphen-Labs.com"> hyphen-labs </a>.

I like analog and digital tools, food, sounds, textures, and sights.
