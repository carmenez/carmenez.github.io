Day 2.  I’m getting used to a longer commute, I can usually read one (maaayyybbbeee 2) pages over and over about 4-6 times from the Morgan stop on the L to 14th.  I get distracted by all the New Yorkers shuttled around in little tin cans coming, going, and hosting all sorts.  The metro doesn’t discriminate.

This week is full of ice-breaking, bonding, and drawing.  One of the most exciting things is that CLASS STARTED ON TIME! wow. It’s great to be part of a community that cares about their experience enough that they actively make an effort to participate.  It is encouraging to see my piers as well as my teachers at sfpc and ready at the time they said they would be.

Human Fax Machine + Simple Rules Drawings.  Zach asked us to participate in a few exercises that got us thinking like computers.  In human fax machine, we were asked to communicate through sound.  to do this one must create a protocol for converting drawings into sound.  Then, define rules for sending and receiving in order to transform information from one language to another.  We started with directional representations and their sounds(up(mount sound)/down(heavy hand on table)/left(flick on the table)/right(scratch the table)) + (pause//clap) Then we established a set of rules. 1. sound out coordinates (x,y) on the page, when complete, pause. 2. draw a unit of line for each sound representation heard. 3. pause when complete.  This was a really interesting way of defining rules and the importance of being specific.  Although the rules were specific, it was difficult for us to translate the sounds to images.  There was a lot of thinking, eyebrow furrowing, and starting over.
Drawing got us to follow simple rules that allowed us to generate without thinking.  The goal was to be fill up a big sheet of paper quickly by turning the rules into a drawing.

Exercise 1: start by drawing a straight line at any length, angle, and position.  Next line can only be drawing on previous lines & no crossing.

Exercise 2: Fill the circle to make it perfect.

Exercise 3: Make your own rules: draw 90 degree arcs in any direction.  Next arc must be offset a few units from any arc and drawing in any direction on any point on the line.

I really loved this exercise.

I also did my own interpertations
