Prompt:live without google

First I thought this was simple.  Throw the phone away. I've done it before, I love doing it, and the addiction to the digital pet we call our iphones is really annoying. Letting go of my attachment to my devices is like letting the dog off the leash.  It may run in to traffic and die or in our cases as 'digital media artists' destroy potential career opportunities becuase we didn't respond to that company that wanted to hire us...but what is the price you will pay for freedom? 

So, I started looking around the internet, searching for alternatives that won't use my data to sculpt my internet experience.  Well, it turns out, most of the sites that I frequent...use google, have been acquired by google, or are made by google. 
So, what are these you ask? 
Here's the shortlist: google search, google maps, gmail, youtube, google calendar, google groups, google drive, google translate, google docs & google hangouts.
Here's the long list: <a href= "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_mergers_and_acquisitions_by_Alphabet"/> Acquired by Alphabet</a>

What does this make me feel? well, google can delete me. they have access to all of my information & they reserve the right to delete my account, at any time, for any reason, with or without notice.  This means: my calendar, my precious documents, my google phone number, my favorite youtube videos!!  I really need the search engine, since I am always watching tutorials, the email makes my life much easier + the interface is user friendly & easy to use...especially when I have to troubleshoot with my mom (who, btw, is a rockstar internetter). 

So in this exercise:

for internet browsing -------
I will have to switch my default web browser.If I had my choice, my next preference is Firefox, but i can’t use that, or opera.  So…safari? Nope. Begrudgingly i can use bing or yahoo…but actually they are just as big and don’t mind my privacy! so my final option is: duck duck go- but i'm usig it through chrome, so i'm using google anyway, right? Well at least i'm not being tracked...my other options include Quora, Dogpile, Yandex [from russia], ixquick,

for video ----
vimeo 

for music -----
soundcloud

for maps----- 
HERE Maps + get lost & ask people questions

&&
to get less googled: 
disable location tracking
opt out of data tracking

+ Good Luck
