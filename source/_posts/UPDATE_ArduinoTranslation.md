Code poem

I spent hours deliberating over logic, thinking, rules, and wrestling with the vast unknown of code, poetry, and translation.

I barely trust myself. I forget that my experience has cultivated an aesthetic. I need to trust my instinct. I'm a maker. A designer and I'm a retired engineer. 

For the past few years I have been using the arduino platform to creat fantastical-Exploratorium feeling projects so it's a platform I'm familiar with.  I delivered a translation program. 

I took an existing heart beat code. One that is used on android devices. This code, in English, is simple, turns on pins to high and low. 

Re-writing this poem gave me a heart. 

I bought a man a pastry, he smelled of long days without a shower. His bags filled with newspapers, his winter clothes wrapped around his waist.  He acted as if he was invisible.

many things sweetly translate when seen through code.  the complications of loss and love can be simplified to booleans, vars, longs, and if's.  

I've recently lost someone and have felt trapped in the void loop. Forced to create breakpoints in order to debug the entire source code.  Its a long complicated code, un-tabbed & messy.  missing comments it has become unclear, but runs forever, although over time glitches, gets slow, breaks, and is unable to compile.
