John whitney used mathematics and analog machines to bend the minds of those who loved the digital pioneer. Made in 1961, the video above states that this is his "demo reel: work created with his analog computer/film camera magic machine he built from a WWII anti-aircraft gun sight. Also Whitney and the techniques he developed with this machine were what inspired Douglas Trumbull (special fx wizard) to use the slit scan technique on 2001: A Space Oddessey."
