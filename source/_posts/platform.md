Code and Platform asked us to evaluate an existing platform re-imagine it in a different light. I chose to explore the iPhone OS as a platform.  

The idea of this prompt was to look at an existing platform, (i.e. old gaming console or language) and re-imagine it with another use. Hyperattention, and the cell phone as an extension of our "selves" has created a peculiar relationship with our "personal" technology. 

The constant need to re-fresh, update, capture, has made us co-dependant with our mobile devices.  
 
Questions: how could the platform itself be redesigned to address this?  Could the iPhone OS platform be designed in such a way that wouldn't demand constant attention?

I was actually looking at the idea of an APP as a platform.  An attention grabbing rounded cornered square that beggs for our touch, interaction, and engagement.  It conscerns me to see more and more people with ADHD in the real world, and hyperAttention in the phone's world.  So, for those of you who feel like your apps have gotten out of control.  You're lost in a sea of internet connectness that you actually feel more alone.  Or you believe that other people's updates, feeds, and chats rob your precious time...

check out: nono.

Nono is an app to get you off your apps.  With padawan, jedi, and zen master levels, you can choose to be distraction free for 5, 15, or 30 minutes.  It's black screen with the letters n-o-n-o will remind you that, your phone-free time hasn't ended and to put the phone away and engage with the world around you.
