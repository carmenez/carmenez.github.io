Face++ started from SnapChat.  We were swapping faces and noticed that there were a few facial recognition commands that the application recognized. We decided to expand our language from a – “Open your mouth” and “Raise your eyebrows” – to 16 different facial expressions.
We decided to figure out a way to write a programming language that would run on laughter.  You can write using your face and once you’ve created your code, trigger laughter to compile and run it.  Melanie pointed out that this would actually be a great programming language for people with disabilities, more specifically targeting those who are paralyzed from the neck down.

Experimenting a little bit with the code, we switched in some images from the Codex Seraphinianus to generate some beautiful tiling patterns, resulting in the featured image.

Some other really beautiful coding languages were created.  Melanie translated a simple, “helloWorld” to 7 of the most common languages. And Max created a mobile to hang above your babies crib so your child can get familiar with coding(?). KristaAnn created a programming language from Tarot Cards, and Min created instructions for programmers. (i think)
