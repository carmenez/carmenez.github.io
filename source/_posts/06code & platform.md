We met with Nick Monfort, http://nickm.com/, MIT associate professor, and super human.  A friendly code master he introduced us to the Demoscene, a meet up for people who like to compete and show their computational skills.
We started his class learning about some of his work and jumped into playing around with some of the code he has written. We first talked about:

1952 Memory Slam- Early generated text to produce love letters.
     input: punch cards
     output: tele typewriter
can a machine be capable of expression
empty words- makes a statement about the love letter â€“ meaningless?
phatic speach-no meaning (no information)
is the meaning made from the interpreter
ambiguous authorship-machine or programmer
historically: love letters written by someone other than the person who is sending them. so is the machine doing labor? is this a business application?
He showed us how to play with the script using javascript or python and invited us to create our own poetry.
