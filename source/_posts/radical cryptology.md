155 Bank St – WestBeth once the Bell Telephone Laboratories (between 1898 and 1966) now a building for Artists and The School for Poetic Computation is an industrial complex. Brick exterior and welcoming public spaces leave its visitors feeling like they are visiting an oasis in the west village.  as we are studying within a complex that influenced, transformed and developed modern day technology. –http://ethw.org/Bell_Labs
Claude Shannon – 1916-2001- After graduating in 1936, Shannon went directly to MIT to take up a work-study position he had seen advertised on a postcard tacked to a campus bulletin board…

This was a man who would explore machine learning in the 1940’s.  A researcher who “demonstrated the essential unity of all information media, pointing out that text, telephone signals, radio waves, pictures, film and every other mode of communication could be encoded in the universal language of binary digits, or bits-a term that his article was the first to use in print.” A man who would go on to publish, develop, and push the technology of the modern time.

So, what was on the card that gave him a reason to start working at Bell Labs? Was it a graphic? Was he in need for money and going to take the first job he could get? What was the visual vernacular? How did graphic artists explain technology?

I saw Megan Prelinger speak at Grey Area and discuss the graphic design in early technology.  the early radio, telephone, and electricity companies in the United States were shown to the public through a graphic language. Technology and graphic design grew together through two mediums: trade literature and science fiction.  Prelinger states that visual images were used to attract budding engineers by advertising utopian worlds through a scientific lens.  Circuit schematic symbols were used in the begenning of design and art with electronics.  Begenning with simplified lines & form in the 1950’s then moving to numbers binary.
