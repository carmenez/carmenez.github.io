Prompt: Create an autonomous online network

Well, what is an autonomous network?

A Rhizome is: a continuously growing horizontal underground stem that puts out lateral shoots and adventitious roots at intervals. 

An autonomous network allows the users to deflect "normal" networking systems. I decided to create an autonomous network for the MTA riders.  Having been part of the design and maintenance of Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART) and a public transit rider, I have experienced the "unknown delay." Often I think about how the underground experience is without internet, and its users have  to depend on the train conductor to get information about the status of our charriot. What is happening? How long will we be here? Can I take another change? NO SIGNAL, results in confused, aggrivated, and unhappy commuters.  

What if a [mesh] network could exist so individuals could get real time information from somewhere above the water table.  If a train has been stopped for more than 10 minutes, an autonomous network would appear and allow us to find out from news sources if there has been a malfunction, an attack, any issue that has caused the infrastructure to stop performing and alert us to alternatives on how to move around, giving us control of our commute.
