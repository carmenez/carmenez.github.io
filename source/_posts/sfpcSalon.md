We didn’t have class today, but we got to see some amazing speakers as well as spend some time in the space.

As I am looking over my notes these are the things that stand out to me:
Be Agressively Curious

Try to be a collector

The world is hungry for your ideas

Questions lead to conversations which lead to learning

Ask about anything…SFPC’s resources work for us now

Together we know more

Simplicity is key

Artistic practice is research

Take your time to learn things

Surround yourself with people that help you understand your value & are supportive.

APPLY TO EVRYTHING!
